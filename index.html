      <h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>
      <p class= pad-b">We are a not-for-profit organization made up entirely of volunteers who are dedicated to the safety and welfare of the Shiba Inu breed. Shiba Rescue GTA is a bridge between a Shiba’s past life and the future forever home. </p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Why is there a Shiba Rescue?</h3>
      <p>There are many reasons why a dog ends up in rescue. Sometimes they were purchased impulsively by people who did not understand the temperament of the breed. Sometimes lifestyle changes such as job loss or divorce dictate giving up a pet.</p>
      <p>Other dogs lose their homes when their owners become too sick or elderly to provide them with necessary care. Still others are dumped by owners who just no longer wanted them. Some Shibas come into rescue by way of animal shelters, humane societies, newspaper ads and word of mouth.</p>
      <p>No matter how the Shiba arrives in our program, every dog is taken to a veterinarian for a health evaluation, any necessary treatment, updated with current vaccinations, heartworm tested and put on a preventative. All Shiba Rescue GTA dogs will be neutered or spayed prior to adoption.</p>
      <h3 class="text-center">What We Do</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We provide a central point of contact for shelters and to those individuals seeking help finding a new home for their Shiba.
        <li>We co-ordinate fund-raising and fund distribution to aid Shiba rescue and adoption.
        <li>We provide information to educate the general public about the Shiba Inu breed and Shiba Inu Rescue GTA.
        <li>We support The Toronto Shiba Inu Meetup group where Shiba owners can share their experience with the breed.
